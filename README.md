# 8080

The complete emulation of the Intel 8080 CPU written completely in C99. 


Goals:


- Make it as readable as possible without the cost of performance.

- Make it portable; It has been tested on MacOS Ventura (13.x) and Fedora 36. **(Windows compatibility will come soon)**

- Make it as accurate; tried different test suites, like the [Intel 8080 KR580VM80A (Russian model) exerciser](https://github.com/begoon/i8080-core) and the altairclone being one of them.
